## P Value 

##### Definition 
Actually if the null hypothesis is true, p value is the probability of getting the result as at least as extreme as the current one. 
 
Case I : Researchers create a new drug and conduct experiments

Null hypothesis : There is no difference
Alternate hypothesis : There is difference 

If the p value is 80%, it means that there is no difference (the probablity of getting at least the current actual value is very high, meaning there is no significat difference)
If the p value is 1%, it means that there is difference (the probability of getting at least as the current actual value is very less, meaning there is significant difference)

Low P Value : Reject null hypthesis 
High P Value : Fail to reject null hypothesis, accept alternate hypothesis



# Type I and II Error

1. Type I Error : Incorrectly reject null hypothesis (false positive)
2. Type II Error : Failure to reject null hypothesis (false negative)
